## 📁 Contents

- 📓 **Jupyter Notebook**  
  Full pipeline including:
  - Dataset exploration and visualization  
  - Data preprocessing and cleaning  
  - Model training (classification & regression)  
  - Evaluation and performance metrics

- 🧠 **Classifier Model**  
  Predicts whether a Stirling motor will require maintenance based on real-time captor readings (flow rate, temperatures, pH...).

- ⚙️ **Regression Model**  
  Estimates the current efficiency of a Stirling motor (in %) using the same captor data.

- 📊 **Simulated Dataset**  
  Includes realistic industrial sensor data with some added noise and edge cases to simulate real-world scenarios.
